# RL_crypto_trader

I built my own RL trading agent using PyToch and a custom enviornmnet for the agent to train in using OpenAI's gym. 

Please download the data for hourly bitcoin prices on Coinbase: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q2zkWDeRam59HlFdLWl6fQAh6LCuUdyk/view?usp=sharing

Put this csv file in a folder named "data" in the main project directory.

Then, run the Custom_RL.py file to see it work!
